# LJ Code 201 Day 8
Today was a lot better than the rest of this week. I'm began to understand concepts a little better. My biggest problem is that I sometimes forget how to use the tools (code) in front of me and actually make useful code. Also, while I felt good about my code, I don't think I could've done as good of a job as I did without the help I got today. Thankful.
