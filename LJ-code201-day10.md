# # LJ Code 201 Day 10  

Today wasn't the least stressful day this week. The assignment for the weekend is something I feel comfortable doing. As far as how I'm feeling about the learning material, a lot of things are starting to slowing click and I'm understand how i apply some of the things we've learned. For some reason when we do the review for the week, I start to understand things. I dont know if it because the wording is broken down to layman's terms but whatever it is, it's working.
