#  LJ Code 201 - Day 1


Today was a lot more productive than the rest of the week. I was able to find the solutions to all my problems. There are a few things I feel like I need to review and those are:

  - How Loop's REALLY work
  - The order my code should be in
  - READING THE DOCS.

I think that if I can do those three things, I'll be in a good place.
