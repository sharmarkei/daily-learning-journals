# # LJ Code 201 Day 19

Bittersweet feeling to be honest. Feel like I've learned so much this past month that my brain is still trying to catch up. The presentations had me really nervous, I suck at public speaking. You maybe couldn't tell but I was shaking (both my voice and actually body). Sad that some of the people I've become close with out the month aren't continuing this journey with me but that's life I guess.
