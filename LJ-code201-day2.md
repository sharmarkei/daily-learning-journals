# H1 LJ Code 201 - Day 1
Today is day two. So far I feel pretty comfortable with the material we've learned.
I think having done so many tutorials prior to the class and also having my sibling
who know how to code is what's helping be on top of  my things. I was trying to do
making my about_me game a little more interesting today. I didn't want it to be a
standard 'Y/N' game but rather something that utilized my knowledge. That being said,
I decided to add a while loop to my game. The while loop makes it so that the answer given
will be rejected till the correct answer is found. Took me about 30 mins to figure out how
to do it on my own.
