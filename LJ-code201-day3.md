# LJ Code 201 Day 3

### Today was by far the hardest day yet. We learned about FOR/WHILE statements. I thought I had a good understand of them before the class and I turned out to be correct. I don't know why it didn't dawn on me sooner to use the For Loops to help have me so much typing time. Anyways, I had a few 'Ah Ha' moments today, the first bring when I started to really understand how powerful loops can be. Sudden ideas started flooding in as to different way I could use Loops to make my code look so much easier. I didn't get to go to deep into those ideas today because I felt like my understand of Loops are okay for the time being and wanted to focus more on CSS.

###Before I get into CSS, I just wanted to mention that I was able to turn about 13-15 lines of code into 5-6 line. **THIS BLEW MY MIND!** I actually began to feel like a real life programmer after that. Okay, back to the CSS now. I think CSS is probably the hardest thing about front end development. With CSS, there are so much to design and if you don't know what each tag does you start to get lost and confused. I made it a mission to become the next CSS wizard at CF, even better than Brian! Well that's it for today.
